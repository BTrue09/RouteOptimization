The idea is to create an algorithm that can determine the best order to load trucks
It would also ideally give advice on what pickers should be on what truck in order to
do it in the quickest way and so that people are not getting ahead of the pallet in front
of them.

This may result in a large differentiation in the picked cases across pickers, but
I believe that it will result in a quicker load time and lead to faster completion of work

Say the fastest 3 pickers load the two longest trucks in the same amount of time the next
3 fastest pickers load the next 2 longest trucks and so on. 
Then the order to bring up the trucks is all that has to be determined and to manually place
certain pickers on those trucks is what has to be done

-First need to learn how trucks are determined to load and how a route is determined to go
on a certain truck
    -Will need to talk to Dylan about how to determine what truck goes with what route
    -Will need to talk to boss Dylan about how the system works and how to gain access
        to the information
    -How do they know this truck needs to be this length, and then if it is based solely
        on number of pallets or cases, etc can that be used in correlation with the 
        planned pick time. 
        -If planned time is x and pickers on that truck have a DPS over 100 then that
        truck will be loaded faster than the planned pick and be done 
        -Those pickers can begin on other pickers trucks until a new truck is brought up
        for them to pick for
    -So maybe the 5 longest trucks aren't brought up to start, but rather the longest, then 
    3rd longest, etc so that way the best pickers can load the 2 longest trucks in relatively
    the same time as say the next couple. 
    -Would have to experiment and determine the optimal way
    -If it is all based on statistics and the avg previous couple days Cases/hour or DPS
    then the amount of time a truck would take to can be determined and ALL trucks in a day
    can be determined based off of who is picking on what truck.
-Then need to have the information of the bulk cases for that truck and the planned pick time
-The trucks with the higher pick times should have the best pickers and should be brought up
first. 
-Trucks with a lot of fulls should be brought up towards the end unless they have a high
pick time. 
-The beginning trucks that have a lower pick time should go to the slower pickers
-New hires should get their own truck and it should be out of the way, ideally door 16 or 12
-Determine the best pickers based on recent results of cases per hour
-Each picker has stats associated already within an excel spreadsheet that is generated
-Determine the best picker based off of Cases/Hour


Ex:
    Picker{
        Name
        Cases Picked
        Cases/Hr
    }

    Truck{
        Number
        Pallets
        Full Pallets
        Bulk cases to pick
        Planned route pick time
    }
