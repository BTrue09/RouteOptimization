# RouteOptimization --Brayden Truex--
Summer Project designed to optimize a sequence of trucks from a text file that places them in an order that allows for them to be loaded in the quickest order.
This project is used with text files that were created via excel.
The project may be modified depending upon feedback and more accurate data corresponding with actual work times
